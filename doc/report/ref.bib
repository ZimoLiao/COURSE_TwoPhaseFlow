We discuss the essential ideas behind the techniques, the coupling of these techniques to finite-difference methods for incompressible and compressible flow, and a collection of applications including two-phase flow, ship hydrodynamics, and ink-jet-printhead design.},

	abstract = {Accurate modeling of interfacial flows demands a realistic representation of interface topology. Vorticitydriven stretching and tearing near the interface typifies the topological changes that must be captured by a method. Methods devised t o track interfaces should model these topology changes in a realistic and robust fashion, thus they must be effective when vorticity is dominant. Four different test problems are used for evaluation of interface tracking methods: simple translation, solid body rotation, a single vortex, and a complex deformation field. The latter two test problems are particularly stringent, being characterized by strong vortical velocity fields. All of the test problems can be evaluated meaningfully with qualitative and quantitative measures. We demonstrate the ability of modern interface tracking methods t o model topology changes by evaluating and comparing the performance of four different methods as applied t o the test problems. The methods studied are monotone slope-limited shock capturing techniques, a volume-of-fluid (VOF) method, a level set method, and a marker particle method. We assess the usefulness of each method for tracking interfaces in interfacial flows characterized by large topology change.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider reinitializing level functions through equation /tþ sgnð/0Þðkr/k À 1Þ ¼ 0 [16]. The method of Russo and Smereka [11] is taken in the spatial discretization of the equation. The spatial discretization is, simply speaking, the second order ENO ﬁnite difference with subcell resolution near the interface. Our main interest is on the temporal discretization of the equation. We compare the three temporal discretizations: the second order Runge–Kutta method, the forward Euler method, and a Gauss–Seidel iteration of the forward Euler method. The fact that the time in the equation is ﬁctitious makes a hypothesis that all the temporal discretizations result in the same result in their stationary states. The fact that the absolute stability region of the forward Euler method is not wide enough to include all the eigenvalues of the linearized semi-discrete system of the second order ENO spatial discretization makes another hypothesis that the forward Euler temporal discretization should invoke numerical instability. Our results in this paper contradict both the hypotheses. The Runge–Kutta and Gauss–Seidel methods obtain the second order accuracy, and the forward Euler method converges with order between one and two. Examining all their properties, we conclude that the Gauss–Seidel method is the best among the three. Compared to the Runge–Kutta, it is twice faster and requires memory two times less with the same accuracy.},

	abstract = {A local level set algorithm for simulating interfacial ﬂows described by the two-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations is presented. The governing equations are solved using a ﬁnitedifference discretization on a Cartesian grid and a second-order approximate projection method. The level set transport and reinitialization equations are solved in a narrow band around the interface using an adaptive reﬁned grid, which is reconstructed every time step and reﬁned using a simple uniform cell-splitting operation within the band. Instabilities at the border of the narrow band are avoided by smoothing the level set function in the outer part of the band. The inﬂuence of different PDE-based reinitialization strategies on the accuracy of the results is investigated. The ability of the proposed method to accurately compute interfacial ﬂows is discussed using different tests, namely the advection of a circle of ﬂuid in two different time-reversed vortex ﬂows, the advection of Zalesak’s rotating disk, the propagation of small-amplitude gravity and capillary waves at the interface between two superposed viscous ﬂuids in deep water, and a classical test of Rayleigh–Taylor instability with and without surface tension effects. The interface location error and area loss for some of the results obtained are compared with those of a recent particle level set method. Copyright ᭧ 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
